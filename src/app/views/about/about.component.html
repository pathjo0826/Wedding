            The wedding ceremony will be held at Gothenburg Cathedral (Göteborgs Domkyrka) which is located in the
            heart of Gothenburg. The church was originally consecrated in 1633 and later rebuilt in the 19th century. It
            is a stunning, historic landmark easily recognized by its elegant neoclassical architecture. The cathedral
            is the seat of the bishop of the diocese of Gothenburg in the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Sweden.

            The wedding reception following the church ceremony will take place in Eriksberg at River Restaurant On
            The Pier. Eriksberg is located along the northern bank of Gothenburg’s Göta River and was once a bustling
            shipyard. The area is easily recognizable by its iconic red shipyard crane which stands as a bright reminder of
            the neighborhood’s rich industrial history. We have chosen this location to both honor Patrik’s lifelong
            relationship with the maritime as well as pay homage to the waterway that connects us. From the Restaurant you can
            actually see Stena Line’s ferries passing on their way to and from Denmark. The same exact ferries that carried
            Patrik to Denmark when we went on our very first date.
            <br><br>
            <u>Address</u>: Dockepiren, Eriksberg, 417 64, Gothenburg, Sweden.
            <br><br>
            River Restaurant on the Pier is easily accessible by public transportation as well. The closest stops
            are Eriksbergs Färjeläge and Eriksbergstorget.
